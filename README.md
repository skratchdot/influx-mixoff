# influx-mixoff

I remember in the late 90's / early 2000's, there were a number of great websites and mailing lists
that I wish I could look up nowadays.

I remember being on some dj shadow related mailing lists, and the influx mixoffs that took place.

I tried finding some archives, but couldn't find much. The original mixoff website still appears
to exist:

I decided to create a backup of it. The backup was generated using the following command:

```bash
wget --mirror https://www.angelfire.com/ny/influxmixoff/index.html
```
